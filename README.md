# Predicting-Stroke-Risk-Using-Machine-Learning
 About This Project

This repository contains the full implementation of “Predicting Stroke Risk Using Machine Learning on Clinical and Lifestyle Data.”
The project explores how demographic, behavioral, and medical features can be leveraged to identify patients at risk of stroke using advanced machine learning models.

Through comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) , and feature engineering, the study identifies key predictors such as age, glucose level, hypertension, and heart disease.
Models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained to achieve interpretable and accurate predictions.

The project follows best practices in data preprocessing, class balancing using SMOTE, and model evaluation through precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

This work supports the broader goal of early detection and prevention of strokes by providing a data-driven foundation for clinical decision support systems.
