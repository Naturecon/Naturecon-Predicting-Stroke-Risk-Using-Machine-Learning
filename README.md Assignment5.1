# Predicting Stroke Risk Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the full implementation of the project “Predicting Stroke Risk Using Machine Learning on Clinical and Lifestyle Data”,
developed for the MS Applied Artificial Intelligence Program (AAI 590 IN1), University of San Diego, 2025.

The project applies modern data science and machine learning techniques to predict stroke risk using clinical and lifestyle indicators such as
age, hypertension, glucose levels, BMI, smoking habits, and more.

Project Objectives

- Preprocess clinical and lifestyle data for predictive modeling  
- Analyze stroke risk factors using exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Build and compare machine learning models  
- Develop a neural network architecture (Assignment 5.1)  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC  
- Produce interpretable insights for clinical decision support  

-Dataset

Source: Kaggle — Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset (Fedesoriano, 2021)  
Records: 5,110 patients  
Features: 12 demographic, clinical, and lifestyle attributes  
Target: `stroke` (0 = no stroke, 1 = stroke)
